# Improve performance Challenge

## Introduction

This project includes a class called **PrimeGenerator** which will create a list of very large prime numbers. These are needed for a security application.

## Challenge
The challenge is to improve the performance of the **PrimeGenerator** class. The current implementation is slow and inefficient. Your task is to use GenAI tools to improve the code to make it faster and more efficient.

As you work through the challenge you may ask the GenAI tools to keep optimising a number of times - at each point keep a record of how long the process takes so that you can be sure each optimisation is a genuine improvement on the last. 

**How quickly can you get the code to run?** 

## Notes
* **You must not alter the bit length** of the BigIntegers being generated - the security application requires this to be set to 2000.
* Ensure you understand the code being generated - ask the GenAI tools to explain anything you are not sure about.


## Points
This challenge is worth up to 200 points

## Mark Scheme

* 100 points - you have successfully solved the problem
* 100 points - you can explain to your instructor to their satisfaction what the problem was and why the solution works
