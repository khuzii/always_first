# The Perl Upgrade Challenge

## Introduction
Many of the apps found in a lot of large corporations, especially financial corporation are written in Perl. Perl is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used in various domains, including web development, system administration, and data analysis.

However, Perl has some limitations that can make it challenging to maintain and upgrade. One of the most significant challenges is the lack of a comprehensive testing framework. Without proper testing, it can be difficult to ensure that the code is working as expected and to identify and fix any issues that may arise.

For this reason, and many others, Perl is often considered a legacy language, and many organizations are looking to migrate their Perl code to a more modern language.

Your task is  to take the Perl code in this folder and upgrade it to a Python version. 

## The Challenge
First, you will need to work out what this code actually does. Then, you will need to create a Python version of the code that does the same thing. The Python version should be written in a way that is easy to maintain and upgrade. There should also be e a set of tests that can be run to ensure that the code is working as expected.

Your solution to this challenge will be marked on the following criteria:
- The code is written to modern Python standards.
- Your code works!
- You have created a set of comprehensive unit tests that can be run to ensure that the code is working as expected.

## Points
500 points

## Mark Scheme

* 400 points - a complete Python implementation of the required application written to a professional standard following modern pythonic coding standards 
* 100 points - you can explain to the instructor to their satisfaction how the Perl application worked and how the new Python application has mirrored the functionality.
